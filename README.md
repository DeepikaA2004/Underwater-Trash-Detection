# Underwater Trash Detection

## Introduction

Underwater Trash Detection is a project to leverage the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm for real-time identification and classification of underwater debris. The project addresses the critical need for automated systems to detect and mitigate the impact of trash in marine ecosystems.

## Overview

This project utilizes the Ultralytics YOLO framework, employing a YOLOv8 model for efficient and accurate trash detection. The system captures real-time video from a webcam, processes the footage, and overlays bounding boxes with labels for different types of underwater trash. The goal is to provide a user-friendly solution for early detection and intervention to combat underwater pollution.

## Class Names

The YOLOv8 model is trained to recognize the following classes of underwater trash:

1. **Bottle**: Plastic and glass bottles.
2. **Can**: Metal or aluminum cans.
3. **Plastic Bag**: Plastic bags that pose a threat to marine life.
4. **Waste**: General waste items contributing to underwater pollution.

## Conclusion
The Underwater Trash Detection project presents a robust and efficient solution for addressing the growing concern of underwater pollution. By harnessing the power of the YOLOv8 model within the Ultralytics framework, we have successfully developed a system that can identify and classify various types of underwater debris in real time.

This project contributes to environmental conservation efforts and provides a practical tool for researchers, environmentalists, and policymakers to monitor and mitigate the impact of trash in marine ecosystems. The ability to recognize specific classes such as bottles, cans, plastic bags, and general waste enhances the precision of the detection system, enabling targeted intervention strategies.

As we move forward, the significance of automated detection systems in safeguarding our oceans and marine life becomes increasingly apparent. This project is a testament to the potential of advanced computer vision techniques in addressing complex environmental challenges. The user-friendly interface and real-time capabilities empower users to take swift and informed actions, contributing to the ongoing efforts to preserve the delicate balance of aquatic ecosystems.

In the future, further refinements and enhancements to the model, integration with broader environmental monitoring systems, and collaboration with stakeholders can amplify the impact of the Underwater Trash Detection project. Through continued innovation and dedication to environmental stewardship, we strive to make meaningful contributions toward a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable underwater environment.
